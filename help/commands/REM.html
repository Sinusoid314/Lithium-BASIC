<h3>REM remark</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Adds a remark to a rpogram's code. Any REM lines are cut out by the compiler, and
do not effect the program's function in any way. Remarks are placed in code to explain
parts of the code in plain English. An easier way of placing a remark in your code
is to use a <b>'</b> instead of <b>REM</b>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Usage:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>REM</b> this is a remark <br>
<b>'</b> this is also a remark <br>
