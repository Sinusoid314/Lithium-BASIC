<h3>DATA expression, expression, ...</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Allows data to be easily inserted into a program. There can be any number of
<b>expression</b>s, and each one can be any type (String or Number). The data
can be read into variables durring runtime with the <a href="READ.html">READ
</a> command. The data in each <b>DATA</b> statement is local to the sub or
function in which it is defined and, unlike variables, code within subs and
functions cannot read data from global DATA statements. Variables and arrays
should not be used in any data <b>expression</b>s, since all DATA lines are cut
out and evaluated before the program starts.
