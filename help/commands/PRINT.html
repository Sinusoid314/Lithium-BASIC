<h3>PRINT [#handle,] [expression]</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Prints data to the consol window or a file. If <b>#handle</b> is specified, then expression is evaluated and written to the file, and must also be specified. If only <b>expression</b> is specified, then that expression will be evaluated and printed onto the consol window. If neither are specified, then a blank line is printed to the consol window. Placing a <b>;</b>
at the end of the entire PRINT statement will keep it from printing a carriage return to the consol
window or file.
