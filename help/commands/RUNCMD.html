<h3>RUNCMD cmdString</h3>
<br>
<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Executes a Lithium BASIC command as a string expression. This allows a command to
be constructed and changed durring runtime. <i>Note of caution:</i> Since the commands
are executed as string expressions durring runtime, the compiler does not check them
for correct syntax or matching data types. This could cause problems durring execution
of the program if the command string has syntax errors in it, and could potentially
crash the program or even the entire system.
