Lithium BASIC allows for the creation of Windows programs with only a few lines of code.
The main commands that give this ability are <a href="..\commands\WINDOW.html">
WINDOW</a> and <a href="..\commands\CONTROL.html">CONTROL</a>. There are a
collection of commands and functions in Lithium BASIC that allow you to retrieve, or modify,
information about different windows and controls, such as the caption on a button. You can also
capture window events and carry out certain tasks when they occur, such as asking if the user
would like to save their work when they try to close a window. Events are captured using the
<a href="..\commands\EVENT.html">EVENT</a> command. The following sections
give you a list of all the commands, functions, and events associated with windows and
different control types: <br>
