# Lithium-BASIC
A BASIC interpreter for making Windows programs.
The code is a bit rough, as I wrote this back in high school when I
had only a few years of programming experience under my belt. The 
last version to be released is featured on <a href="http://basic.mindteq.com/index.php?i=94">The Basic's Page</a>.
